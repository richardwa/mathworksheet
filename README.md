I wanted horizontal math problems to encourage mental math.  It turns out this is actually easier to teach than the traditional borrow/carry methods.

ex:
47 - 29
expand into
40 - 20 + 7 - 9

then just perfrom the cumlative sum in your head.  


This is much better than traditional approach.
  * problem is done left to right, with most significant digits are done first
  * encourages mental math
  * my little one started reading numbers backwards when i taught the traditional approach, so it led me to believe there is something fundamentally wrong with traditional approach.
